# Code Refractor Project

This project was used to teach me how to update a website for accessibility; also it was used to teach me how to replace HTML elements with HTML semantic elements.

## Getting Started

I created a repository on GitHub.  I created an HTML file in the repository.  I uploaded the starter template from the homework section provided by Jerone Chenette into the new HTMl file. I also uploaded the assets section from the homework to provide the CSS file.   

### Prerequisites

I needed to have GitHub, GitBash and Visual Studio Code downloaded onto my computer to accomplish these tasks.

```
GitHub was used to create the repository.  GitBash was used to clone the repository.  Visual Studio Code was used to make changes to the repository.  GitBash was again used to update the repository in GitHub.  GitHub was used to launch the website.
```

### Installing

- I replaced the HTML with semantic HTML elements:

```
I replaced the <div> codes with either <header>, <section>, <article> or <footer>
```

- I added alt attributes:

```
I gave descriptive alt attributes to the pictures and the icons
```

- I performed the git commands to update the repository on GitHub.

```
I did git status, git add ., git commit -m, and git push
```

- I used GitHub to create a website that reflects the changes I made to my project.
